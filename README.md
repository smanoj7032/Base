1. Visit [DummyAPI.io](https://dummyapi.io/) to get your app ID.
2. Create an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Create a new application and note down the application ID provided.

### 3. Creating `apikeys.properties`

Create a file named `apikeys.properties` in the root of your project and add the following line,
replacing `your_app_id` with the application ID you obtained:

```
APP_ID = your_app_id
```
